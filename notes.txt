Design Decisions.

- Storing data in in-memory database or in a hashtable? I would go with in-memory database. Because if I use hashtable then my state is tied to an instance of a server. This makes scaling up tricky.


/*
HTML5 video JS controls.
Link to Video Mapping
sockets to link mapping

UX tradeoff
- pause everyone when new person joins to sync everyone.
- or let everyone be out of sync and let them catch up on their own.

What is the problem? I am not able to communicate with the backend server using socket.io library.
